A very minimal AIFF player designed for 64 bit x86 architecture. Not gauranteed
to play other aiffs besides the two provided in this repository. The goal
of the project was to understand how to parse aiff files. 

Usage:

/* == using independent player  == */
make playIND
./playIND AIFFs/ByYourSidePt1.aiff
./playIND AIFFs/ByYourSidePt2.aiff
bash backtobask.sh

/* == using libAIFF to parse aiffs  == */
make play
./play AIFFs/ByYourSidePt1.aiff
./play AIFFs/ByYourSidePt2.aiff
bash backtobask.sh
